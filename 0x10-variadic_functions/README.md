# *Variadic Functions in C*
## This project demonstrates the use of variadic functions in C programming language. It consists of four C files that showcase different scenarios:

- 0-sum_them_all.c: A function that takes a variable number of integers and returns their sum.
- 1-print_numbers.c: A function that takes a variable number of integers and prints them to the standard output.
- 2-print_strings.c: A function that takes a variable number of strings and prints them to the standard output.
- 3-print_all.c: A function that takes a variable number of arguments of different types and prints them to the standard output, according to a given format.

### To use the functions provided in this project, you can include the corresponding header files in your C program.
